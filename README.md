# Cancer Classification System
<p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file for a cancer classification model. The model is developed using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.</p>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>he dataset used for this model is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains 569 instances of breast tumor data with 30 features each, computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The dataset is included in the repository in the file `data.csv`. </p>

<h1>Model</h1>
<p>The model developed in the Jupyter Notebook is a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the features in the dataset. The model is developed using the scikit-learn library in Python.

The Jupyter Notebook contains code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Many Models were trained using the Naive Bayes, KNN Model, Logistic Regression, Random Forest algorithms, and achieves an accuracy of 96.5% on the test set with Random Forest Algorithm.</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>The following libraries are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>seaborn</li>
</ul>
<p> You can install these dependencies using pip:</p>
<code>pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn</code>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p> To run the Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository and open the file <b>`Cancer_classification_model.ipynb`</b> in Jupyter Notebook. Run the code cells in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.</p>

<h1> Credits</h1>
<p> The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
